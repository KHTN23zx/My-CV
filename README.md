### Introduction:
Welcome to my CV Data Engineer repository! Here, I present my expertise in data engineering, specializing in Computer Vision (CV) applications.

### Contents:
- *Background:* 
  - With a degree in Mathematics & Computer Science from VNUHCM-University of Science and an impressive score of 8.4/10, I've focused on projects that refine my skills in data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model optimization. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have continuously sought to deepen my knowledge in AI and data science fields, emphasizing self-study and the practical application of theoretical knowledge.

- *Skills and Technologies:* 
  - Proficient in Python, C/C++, and R, with advanced usage of tools and frameworks such as Jupyter Notebook, Git, Apache Spark, Pandas, Matplotlib, SKlearn, and Pytorch. My domain knowledge spans language modeling, machine learning, probability and statistics, and math concepts, underpinning my projects in natural language processing (NLP) and data analysis.

- *Projects:* 
  - Highlights of projects showcasing my abilities in data engineering and machine learning include:
    1. *Proving the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma and its application in dimension reduction* (May 2023 - June 2023): Demonstrated the efficacy of the lemma in reducing dimensions of a dataset of 11,938 64Ã—64 face images, using Gaussian Random Projection.
    2. *Hotel booking demand prediction* (Nov 2022 - Dec 2022): Developed a machine learning model to predict hotel booking demands, employing Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest models.
    3. *Classify customer sentiment analysis* (Sep 2023 - Oct 2023): Utilized the Roberta Pretrained Model and NLP tools for analyzing customer reviews, comparing outcomes with star ratings.
    4. *Program in the Windows environment: Check if two shapes intersect* (June 2022): Implemented an interactive application to detect and visualize the intersection of two shapes.

- *Code Samples:* 
  - Links to repositories displaying my coding expertise in CV-related tasks, reflecting my problem-solving approach and adherence to best practices.
